# Ecoverse
Ecoverse is a dedicated online platform to embrace sustainable practices based on the principles of Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle (RRR). 
1. Reduce - Carbon Footprint Calculator
Ecoverse provides users with an advanced Carbon Footprint Calculator designed to objectively quantify their environmental impact. By inputting specific lifestyle and consumption data, users can access a comprehensive analysis of their carbon emissions. The platform also offers data-driven recommendations to minimise environmental impact based on individual habits.
2. Recycle - Locate Nearby Recycling Centers
For those looking to efficiently participate in recycling, Ecoverse offers a tool for locating nearby recycling centres. Users can input their geographical
coordinates to access a database of local recycling facilities. This database includes critical details such as accepted materials, operating hours, and contact information, fostering informed recycling decisions.
3. Reuse - Circular Economy Shopping
Ecoverse features a user-driven Circular Economy Shopping platform that operates as a marketplace. Here, users can buy and sell products, fostering a circular economy where goods find new life. It allows users to engage in the exchange of secondhand goods or discover eco-friendly products that align with sustainable living principles.
4. Rewarding Sustainability
Ecoverse values responsible actions. Users earn credits by validating recycling centre visits via QR codes and by demonstrating a commitment to reducing their carbon footprint through methods such as submitting utility bills that showcase energy-saving initiatives. These credits can be redeemed in our Circular Economy Shopping section, motivating users to engage in sustainability while reaping rewards.
